# Arithmetic Formatter

This is my solution to the Arithmetic Formatter project from the Scientific Computing with Python course on FreeCodeCamp.

## Description

Arithmetic Formatter is a Python program that formats arithmetic problems and their solutions in a visually appealing way. It takes a list of arithmetic problems as input and arranges them in columns, with the operands aligned on the right and the operator (+ or -) aligned on the left. It also calculates and displays the correct solutions.

Feel free to customize this template to fit your project's specifics.
